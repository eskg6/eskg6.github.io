            <li> In Mid-2014. I moved from the only state I've ever known (Florida) and moved to the land of four seasons, New England. Cheney Tech is the first school I taught at when I moved to Connecticut and it was a great experience. Here I continued to teach different levels of instruction but I had the opportunity teach new subjects for the first, such as Economics and Sociology.

    <h3>Broward County Public Schools</h3>
     <h4> Atlantic Technical College and Technical High School</h4>
        <ul>

            <li> Coconut Creek, FL
            </li>
            
            <li> Teacher
            </li>
            
            <li> 8/2013- 6/2014
            </li>

            <li>Taught the following subjects: Civics and American Government, AP US History, and Modern US History 
            </li>
            
            <li> For the short time I taught at Atalantic Technical High School (ATC), I felt that I found my niche. It was a great exerience teaching so many enthusiastic students, especially since so many of them also obtained career certification in addition to their high school diploma. I taught psychology for the first time here as well as AP US History. I also served as Junior Class Sponsor while at ATC; I was able to introduce new fundraising ideas to help the class earn enough for their prom the following year.

            <h4> Miramar High School</h4>
        <ul>

            <li> Miramar, FL
            </li>
            
            <li> Teacher
            </li>
            
            <li> 8/2006- 6/2013
            </li>

            <li>Taught the following subjects: AP World History, AP Human Geography, and World Geography 
            </li>
            
            <li> Miramar High School will always hold a special place in my heart; it was the first school I worked at after graduating college. It was here that I developed my passion for being of service to my students and to help improve the school. In addition to entrusting AP Human Geography to me (a HUGE deal as a first year teacher) and later teaching AP World History, I coordinated different activities and events. I served as Extended Learning Coordinator for standardized testing (Saturday exam pprep) for a variety of exams. I also started the Model UN as well as assisted with the Debate Club.
