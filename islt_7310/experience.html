<h1>Teaching and Professional Experience</h1>   
    
<section id= "section1">
    <h3>Broward County Public Schools</h3>
     <h4> Atlantic Technical College and Technical High School</h4>
        <ul>

            <li> Coconut Creek, FL
            </li>
            
            <li> Teacher
            </li>
            
            <li> 8/2013- 6/2014
            </li>

            <li>Taught the following subjects: Civics and American Government, AP US History, and Modern US History 
            </li>
            
            <li> For the short time I taught at Atalantic Technical High School (ATC), I felt that I found my niche. It was a great exerience teaching so many enthusiastic students, especially since so many of them also obtained career certification in addition to their high school diploma. I taught psychology for the first time here as well as AP US History. I also served as Junior Class Sponsor while at ATC; I was able to introduce new fundraising ideas to help the class earn enough for their prom the following year.

       </ul>
    
            <h4> Miramar High School</h4>
        <ul>

            <li> Miramar, FL
            </li>
            
            <li> Teacher
            </li>
            
            <li> 8/2006- 6/2013
            </li>

            <li>Taught the following subjects: AP World History, AP Human Geography, and World Geography 
            </li>
            
            <li> Miramar High School will always hold a special place in my heart; it was the first school I worked at after graduating college. It was here that I developed my passion for being of service to my students and to help improve the school. In addition to entrusting AP Human Geography to me (a HUGE deal as a first year teacher) and later teaching AP World History, I coordinated different activities and events. I served as Extended Learning Coordinator for standardized testing (Saturday exam pprep) for a variety of exams. I also started the Model UN as well as assisted with the Debate Club.

            </li>
            
            <li> When I taught Advanced Placement classes, I applied and became a Reader for two subjects: AP Huamn Geography and AP World History. Through the process of scoring essays, I gained a better understanding of how to teach my students writing skills while also meeting and collaborating with teachers and academics from around the world.
