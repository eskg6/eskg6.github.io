     Hello World! My name is Erica Suarez and I am a High School Social Studies teacher in Connecticut. In my 14 year career (phew!) I have taught most types of social studies classes, at different instructional levels. This is my first semester at the University of Missouri and I chose this Masterâ€™s program because I want to be able to support my students the best that I can. 
     I have absolutely no web application/development training or experience, so this is my first time learning about this topic. My expectation for the course is to learn how to create a website from scratch and by doing so, have a better understanding of the development process when using technology in the classroom.
     When I am not teaching, I have finally gotten back into the habit of reading (yay teaching from home!) and spending time with my family: husband, 4-year-old son, and dog. If I am feeling especially motivated, I love crafting- usually something from Pinterest.
