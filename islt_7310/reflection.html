    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
<p>     Not many people can say they knew what they wanted for a career when they were in high school. I knew even before graduating that I wanted to be a teacher- a history teacher. I have always felt a calling to public service; my parents and grandparents were police officers. However, I chose a different path: education. It was here that I learned that teaching is less of a career choice but for me, a calling. Maybe it is because I love the content that I teach or that I love to learn; perhaps because I love interacting with people or I feel a person can always learn something new or exciting. It is for this reason that I feel that if this is my true calling in life, I want to be as knowledgeable as I can be.
</p>
    
<p>     I currently teach in a technical high school in Connecticut and have taught in Florida in the past. The longer I teach, I realize how little  students know about how to use technology in academic settings. Research, higher order thinking skills, and finding and citing evidence are areas where my students struggle. This generation has been called “digital natives” but while students of today can use their phones to post or comment, I believe they lack the skills to truly utilize technology in a meaningful way. This is why learning about advances in technology is so important; it is for this reason I am pursuing a master’s degree in Educational Technologies and Design. I believe that I will be able to reach my students by making learning more exciting and hopefully, they gain more of an understanding of the content and how to apply that knowledge to other disciplines or subjects. I also hope to use the skills I learn to share with other teachers during professional in-service; some of the best professional development I have received has been from coworkers.
</p>

<p>     My teaching experience has allowed me to work with a variety of students. I have had the opportunity to teach all levels of students from different backgrounds at two public magnet schools and two public technical high schools, as well as in urban and suburban districts. I started my teaching career in Florida and I now live and teach in Connecticut. Because of teaching in multiple states and different levels of rigor (from standard level to Advanced Placement, ESL, Special Education), I believe that my experiences may set me apart from other teachers. I hope that by addressing or providing different perspectives of students, I will be able to contribute in a productive way and can gain insight from other educators’ experiences as well.

    <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
<p>     All of my experiences have shaped the teacher that I am today: teaching in two states, multiple subjects, and at different levels of instruction. The next phase of my career will involve technology-driven instruction. While the content may not change (too much), how best to reach students does and as a result, I believe teachers should learn technology to better serve their students. I want to achieve my goal of becoming an engaging teacher by using technology more effectively in the classroom setting. It is for this reason I would like an opportunity to learn how to teach my students how to utilize technology in a meaningful way as well as to improve my understanding of learning technology.
